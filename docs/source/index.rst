======================================================

Welcome to the discord-ui docs!
This is a "extension" (I guess) or whatever you want to call it for `discord.py <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py>`__

We (`Redstone <https://github.com/RedstoneZockt>`__ and me) decided to create a pip package for the 
new ui features that discord added. If you want to keep using our lib with dpy2, we added support for discordpy2 


.. important::

   If you want to use slash commands, in the oauth2 invite link generation, 
   you have to check both ``bot`` and ``application.commands`` fields

      :width: 1000

We got some cool features for you like:

.. note::

   *  Sending buttons and select menus very easy
   *  Receiving their interaction
   *  Responding to their interacion
   *  Creating slashcommands, subcommands and subcommand groups
   *  Receiving them and respond to them, including message components
   *  Setting up permissions for slash commmands
   *  Deleting unused slash commands
   *  Creating and receiving the new context commands

   and some more things

.. important::
   
   The ``Messageable.send`` and ``Webhook.send`` functions are overriden by default with our custom method. 
   If you're using dpy2, the default ``discord.ext.commands.Bot`` is overriden with a custom Bot that enables degbug events
   in order to let our lib function proberly

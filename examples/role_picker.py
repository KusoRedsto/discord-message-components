# Example by 404kuso
# https://github.com/KusoRedsto/discord-message-components/tree/main/examples/role_picker.py
# 
#       This example will use a slash subcommand and will send a select menu only visible to the user,
#       where the user can choose between roles to get
#
# Note: For this example to work, the bot has to have the MANAGE_ROLES permission and the bot role
#       has to be higher than the roles.
#       Also, if you want to test this, replace '785567635802816595' in guild_ids=[] with a guild id of 
#       your choice, because guild slash commands are way faster than globals
# 
#       Replace '867715564155568158', '867715628504186911', '867715582903582743' and '867715674386071602'
#       with roles you want to give the user
